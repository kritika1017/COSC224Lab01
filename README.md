Git and GitHub Lab: Collaborative Development


Tasks:

For this lab, we decided to create a Registration Form Webpage with the following five branches:

1.Registrationform
Includes form.html, which contains the HTML code for the registration form

2.regFormcss
Includes formstyle.css, which contains the CSS code for styling the registration form.

3.webpageStyle
Includes webpageStyle.css, which provides the CSS for the basic design of the webpage (e.g., header, footer, sidebar).

4.Javascript
Includes script.js, which contains JavaScript code for client-side validation of the registration form.

5.webpage
Includes webpage.html, which contains the main HTML structure of the webpage.

Development Workflow
To ensure a smooth development process, we followed these steps:

Branch Creation:
Each team member created a dedicated branch to implement specific features. Branch names followed proper naming conventions for clarity.

Feature Implementation:
Features were developed in isolation within their respective branches:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files were added and committed to their branches.
Pull Requests:

After implementing features, pull requests were created to merge changes into the main branch.
Each pull request included descriptive comments and a summary of changes.
Pull requests were reviewed by another team member to ensure code quality and adherence to project requirements.
Code Reviews and Collaboration:

We reviewed each otherâ€™s code, left comments, and suggested improvements before approving pull requests.
Feedback from reviews was incorporated to enhance the final code.
Merging to Main:

After approval, branches were merged into the main branch.
Final Code
The main branch contains the complete and functional code for the project, including:

The registration form with client-side validation.
CSS styling for both the form and the overall webpage layout.
JavaScript for form validation logic.
The webpage HTML structure with header, footer, and additional elements.
Key Learnings
This lab helped us practice:

Creating and managing Git branches for feature development.
Writing clear and descriptive pull requests.
Collaborating effectively by reviewing and merging code changes.
Understanding the importance of version control in team-based projects.
