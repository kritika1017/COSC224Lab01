Git and GitHub Lab: Collaborative Development

Tasks:
In this lab, we created a Registration Form Webpage with five distinct branches:

1. Registrationform
This branch includes form.html, which contains the HTML code for the registration form.

2. regFormcss
This branch includes formstyle.css, which holds the CSS code for styling the registration form.

3. webpageStyle
This branch includes webpageStyle.css, which provides the CSS for the overall design of the webpage (e.g., header, footer, sidebar).

4. Javascript
This branch includes script.js, which contains the JavaScript code for client-side validation of the registration form.

5. webpage
This branch includes webpage.html, which contains the main HTML structure of the webpage.

Each team member created a different branch to work on specific features. 
After implementing features, pull requests were created to merge changes into the main branch.
Each pull request included detailed comments and a summary of the changes made.
Another team member reviewed the pull requests before merging it to main branch. 

Main Branch :
The main branch contains the complete code for the project, which includes:

The registration form with client-side validation.
CSS styling for both the form and the webpage layout.
JavaScript for the form validation logic.
The HTML code for the webpage.
