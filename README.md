Git and GitHub Lab: Collaborative Development
This repository showcases our implementation of Git and GitHub practices for collaborative software development. The lab focuses on using Git to create and manage branches, pull requests, and collaborative workflows for implementing features in a small project. Below is a detailed description of our work:

Task Overview
For this lab, we decided to create a Registration Form Webpage with the following key components:

A registration form with client-side validation
CSS styles for the form and the overall webpage design
JavaScript for form validation
A basic webpage layout including header, footer, and other elements
Repository Structure
We organized our project using the following branches, each dedicated to a specific feature:

Branches and Their Features
Registrationform

Includes form.html, which contains the HTML code for the registration form.
This branch focused on creating the structure of the registration form.
regFormcss

Includes formstyle.css, which contains the CSS code for styling the registration form.
This branch focused on enhancing the form's appearance.
webpageStyle

Includes webpageStyle.css, which provides the CSS for the basic design of the webpage (e.g., header, footer, sidebar).
This branch focused on creating the overall layout and style for the webpage.
Javascript

Includes script.js, which contains JavaScript code for client-side validation of the registration form.
This branch handled form validation logic.
webpage

Includes webpage.html, which contains the main HTML structure of the webpage.
This branch focused on creating the basic structure of the webpage.
Development Workflow
To ensure a smooth development process, we followed these steps:

Branch Creation:
Each team member created a dedicated branch to implement specific features. Branch names followed proper naming conventions for clarity.

Feature Implementation:
Features were developed in isolation within their respective branches:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files were added and committed to their branches.
Pull Requests:

After implementing features, pull requests were created to merge changes into the main branch.
Each pull request included descriptive comments and a summary of changes.
Pull requests were reviewed by another team member to ensure code quality and adherence to project requirements.
Code Reviews and Collaboration:

We reviewed each otherâ€™s code, left comments, and suggested improvements before approving pull requests.
Feedback from reviews was incorporated to enhance the final code.
Merging to Main:

After approval, branches were merged into the main branch.
Final Code
The main branch contains the complete and functional code for the project, including:

The registration form with client-side validation.
CSS styling for both the form and the overall webpage layout.
JavaScript for form validation logic.
The webpage HTML structure with header, footer, and additional elements.
Key Learnings
This lab helped us practice:

Creating and managing Git branches for feature development.
Writing clear and descriptive pull requests.
Collaborating effectively by reviewing and merging code changes.
Understanding the importance of version control in team-based projects.
